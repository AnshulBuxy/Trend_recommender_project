# Women's Fashion Image Trend Recommender

This project aims to build a trend recommender system for women's clothing using convolutional neural networks (CNN). Given an image of a woman's clothing item, the system will output five similar clothing items.

## Introduction

The Women's Fashion Image Trend Recommender is a machine learning project designed to suggest similar clothing items based on a provided image. The recommender leverages deep learning techniques to understand and compare clothing styles, offering users fashion recommendations that match their preferences. This project utilizes two powerful convolutional neural network architectures, VGG16 and ResNet-50, to extract features from clothing images and determine similarities.

## Features

- **Image-Based Recommendation**: Input an image of a clothing item to receive suggestions of similar items.
- **Deep Learning**: Utilizes pre-trained VGG16 and ResNet-50 models for feature extraction.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy-to-use interface for obtaining fashion recommendations.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cloth-recommender.git
    cd cloth-recommender
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure you have the necessary dataset of women's fashion images stored in a directory.

## Usage

1. Place the image you want to use for finding similar items in the `input_images` directory.

2. Run the recommendation script:
    ```bash
    python recommend.py --input_image path_to_image.jpg
    ```

3. The script will output the paths to the top 5 similar clothing items and display them.

## Methodology

The project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract features from images of clothing. Specifically, it leverages two architectures:
- **VGG16**: A pre-trained model on the ImageNet dataset, known for its simplicity and effectiveness in feature extraction. The top classification layer is removed to focus on feature vectors.
- **ResNet-50**: Another pre-trained model on the ImageNet dataset, renowned for its deep residual learning framework, which allows it to learn more complex features.

The extracted feature vectors from both models are used to compute cosine similarity between the input image and images in the dataset. The system then recommends the top 5 most similar clothing items based on these similarity scores.

## Results

Upon providing an input image, the system returns the top 5 most similar clothing items based on the extracted feature vectors. This approach ensures that recommendations are visually and stylistically similar to the query image.
